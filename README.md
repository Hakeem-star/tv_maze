Things to do:

* Compartmentalise components in the Components folder into sub folders for clearer navigation.

* Comment the emotion css styles. Maybe use a mix of styled components to make nested selectors clearer.

* Add region selector so you can fetch schedule for other countries - Also automatically detect users region on land.

* Grab Hero image colour on land on Show page.
